I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Cyberbotics Lab at The Ohio State University with six years of hands-on experience as a Robotics Engineer. My expertise lies in creating robuts locomotion controllers for bipedal locomotion through the combination of reinforcement learning and model-based control in both simulations and real-world hardware scenarios.
