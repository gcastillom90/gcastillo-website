title: Template model inspired task space learning for robust bipedal locomotion
summary: A hierarchical framework for bipedal locomotion that combines an RL-based high-level (HL) planner policy for the online generation of task space commands with a model-based low-level (LL) controller to track the desired task space trajectories.
